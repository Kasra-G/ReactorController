This program made by DrunkenKas. 
I wrote almost everything. See Attribution section for details
## Installation:
  To install, place and connect an Advanced Computer to a valid Reactor's Computer Port, <br />
    either with wired modems or directly on it. Then, follow these steps:
  <ol>
    <li>Paste and run the following command: <br />
      &emsp;pastebin run w6vVtrLb</li>
    <li>Reboot</li>
    <li>Optionally calibrate. The output of the calibration is currently unused.</li>
  </ol>

## Configuration:
  Optionally use monitors to configure the program. Once it is configured,
  you do not need monitors anymore. <p>
  Monitors can be used to display information about the reactor. 
  The minimum monitor size is 2x2. Use a height of 4 to have access to all settings.
