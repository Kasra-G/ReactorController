# ComputerCraft Automated Reactor Controller
This program made by DrunkenKas. 
I wrote almost everything. See Attribution section for details
## Installation:
  To install, place and connect an Advanced Computer to a valid Reactor's Computer Port, <br />
    either with wired modems or directly on it. Then, follow these steps:
  <ol>
    <li>Paste and run the following command: <br />
      &emsp;pastebin run kSkwEchg</li>
    <li>Choose whether to calibrate or not. The calibration is not currently used for anything.</li>
  </ol>

## Configuration:
  To configure the program, use monitors. Once it is configured,
  the monitors are no longer necessary but can still display information. <br /><br />
  The minimum monitor size is 2x2. Use a height of 4 to have access to all settings. <br />
  When the monitor is 4 blocks tall, there will be the option to change graphs. <br />
  If there is not enough space to display a graph you will be unable to enable it.
